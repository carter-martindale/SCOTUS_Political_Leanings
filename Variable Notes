Notes about the Data:
-ISSUE: See page 46
The variable codes 260 issues, each of which has an identifying number. They are ordered
below by their larger issue area: criminal procedure (10010-10600), civil rights
(20010-20410), First Amendment (30010-30020), due process (40010-40070), privacy
(50010-50040), attorneys (60010-60040), unions (70010-70210), economic activity
(80010-80350), judicial power (90010-90520), federalism (100010-100130), interstate
relation (110010-110030), federal taxation (120010-120040), miscellaneous
(130010-130020), and private law (140010-140080). These comprise the codes for a
separate variable, Issue Area, that is described immediately following this one.
-Issue Area breaks down all of the above things into larger areas already. So Criminal Procedure = 1, civil rights = 2, 1st amend = 3, due process = 4, privacy = 5, attorney/government fees and compensation = 6, unions = 7, economic activity = 8, judicial power = 9, federalism = 10, interstate relation = 11, federal taxation = 12, misc = 13, private laws = 14
-Specification of direction comports with conventional usage for the most part except for the
interstate relations, private law, and the miscellaneous issues. "Unspecifiable" has been
entered either because the issue does not lend itself to a liberal or conservative description
(e.g., a boundary dispute between two states, real property, wills and estates), or because no
convention exists as to which is the liberal side and which is the conservative side (e.g., the
legislative veto). This variable will also contain "unspecifiable" where one state sues another
under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
-LIberal = 2, Conservative = 1
